* Create project project-name
    zf create project project-name
  
* Create config
    zf create config
  
* Enable layout
    zf enable layout
  
    -> This command will add following line in application.ini file
        resources.layout.layoutPath = APPLICATION_PATH "/layouts/scripts"

    -> It will also add following file as default layout
        application/layouts/scripts/layout.phtml

    -> Layout is a template in zend. Now our layout is created, we would like to edit that.
        * first thing will be to add doctype, lets add HTML 5 doctype. list of available doctypes can be found at http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.view.helpers.html
            * To create doctype, simplest way is to initialize it in bootstrap. Add following function in Application/Bootstrap.php file
                class Bootstrap extends Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Bootstrap
                {
                    protected function _initDoctype()
                    {
                        $this->bootstrap('view');
                        $view = $this->getResource('view');
                        $view->doctype('HTML5');
                    }
                }
            * Here first line loads 'view' resource. So we must define it in application.ini file. To define, add following line in application.ini under production
                resources.view[] =
            * Second line loads the resource named 'view', which we defined as array.
            * Third line add HTML5 as doctype.
        * Now doctype is loaded, we need to display it in our layout. To do that, add following line in application/layouts/scripts/layout.phtml file
            <?php echo $this->doctype() ?>
        * Reload page and check if doctype is loaded or not.
        * Now we can also design template. My template design is available at https://github.com/kapilsharma/kapstest/blob/master/zendtest/application/layouts/scripts/layout.phtml but you can make your own.

* Create modules.
    There are times while working on large application, we might want to divid our application in differnet modules. Zend supports creating multiple modules. Lets create 'library' module for our test application.
        zf create module library
    This will create folder 'library' under applications folder and initilize module with some files.

* Now we need to create controllers. Lets create a controller 'Index'
        zf create controller Index 1 posts
    This will create index controller with respective sample view files. Confirm it in the browser.

* Configure database
    Run following command to configure database
        zf configure db-adapter "adapter=PDO_MYSQL&host=localhost&username=root&password=rootpw&dbname=sample" production
    This will make following entries in the application.ini file
        resources.db.adapter = "PDO_MYSQL"
        resources.db.params.host = "localhost"
        resources.db.params.username = "root"
        resources.db.params.password = "rootpw"
        resources.db.params.dbname = "sample"

zf create controller Create 1 posts
zf create controller Delete 1 posts
zf create controller Update 1 posts
zf create controller View 1 posts
